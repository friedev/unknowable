# TODO

- Mechanics
	- Research to discover quests of varying difficulty and requirements
	- Bribery gets more expensive the more use you use it?
	- Enemies (watch inspectors, rival cultists, eldritch abominations)
		- Separate type
		- Contribute toward negative tasks
		- Can't be moved
		- Each generate an associated assignment to kill them (or, eventually, capture them, etc.)
	- Artifact powers, usable in assignments
		- Followers will still be required to perform the task
		- Artifacts can't "die", but if the last person in the task dies, the artifact is lost?
		- Stat buffs
		- More powerful artifacts generate suspicion
	- Follower stats
		- Health?
		- Strength (combat)
		- Intelligence (artifact seeking)
		- XP
	- Follower statuses
		- Wounded (during a raid or quest)
		- Stressed/unstable (going insane, caused by research, questing, or ritual)
		- Captured (by the watch, during a raid, theft, or bribery)
		- Unavailable (on a quest)
	- Follower, artifact, and wealth capacity?
		- Spend wealth to upgrade
	- Random events?
		- Shouldn't be too powerful, to avoid upsetting the balance
		- Random discoveries during quests
		- Guaranteed events throughout the year/as you progress
	- Only reveal assignments when you first gain their corresponding resource(s) (e.g. reveal bribe when you get wealth)
- Content
	- New raid options
		- Fight them off
			- Gain suspicion
			- Combat check with chance of death, wound, or capture
		- Bribe with LOTS of wealth
	- New assignments
		- Steal
			- Earn large amount of wealth for high suspicion and chance of death (or capture)
		- Recruit cultist
			- Current recruit follower action: spend time and gain suspicion to recruit a cultist
			- Cultists have low strength but decent intelligence
		- Hire mercenary
			- Spend wealth and time to hire a merc with decent strength but zero intelligence
		- Scapegoat?
			- Sacrifice a follower to reduce suspicion
		- Rituals
			- Summon entities which can be used as powerful followers, but only for certain tasks
			- Sacrifice followers and/or artifacts
- UI
	- Click a slot to auto-fill from storage/return to storage
	- Collapse/stack homogeneous resources (e.g. "Wealth x9" instead of "Wealth, Wealth, Wealth..."
		- Drag to take one from the top
		- Drop to stack more
	- Rich custom tooltips, or right click to open an info panel
	- Better way to flow assignments to fit more on the screen
		- HFlow/VFlow cause ugly wrapping by default
		- Idea: Lay out tasks on
	- Full keyboard controls
		- Tab/backtab or arrows/WASD to focus
		- Space to select an entity to move, release to move the selected entity to the cursor
	- Animations when entities are created/destroyed/moved
	- Flavorful popups/reports when things happen at the end of a turn
	- Menu
- Juice
	- Particles? (if possible in a Control scene)
		- Death
		- New follower
		- New artifact
		- Assignment completion
- Sounds
	- Change drag and drop sounds to be less melodic
	- Death
	- New follower
	- New artifact
	- Assignment completion
- Better music
- Procgen end text?
- Procgen art
	- Modulate artifact colors (split into 2 TextureRects: colored and uncolored)
	- Modulate wealth
	- Faces
		- Modulate colors
			- Skin color
			- Hair color
			- Eye color?
		- Others are harder and require some art compatibility matching
			- Face shape
				- This is the main driver of compatibility challenges
				- Limit this to a small number to reduce number of other sprites required
			- Hair
			- Facial hair
			- Facial feature
			- Eyes
	- Conditions
