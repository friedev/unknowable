# TODO

- Mechanics
	- Research to discover quests of varying difficulty and requirements
	- Wealth
		- Followers (of a certain level?) consume money 
		- Replace conceal with bribe
	- Assignment slots
		- Each can hold certain type(s) of entity
		- Some are required, some are optional
		- Ideally: have an HBox of slot icons behind the actual assignment area
		- Worse but definitely possible: fill assignment area with slots
		- The slots themselves should be the droppable area
		- For assignments with unlimited capacity: maintain exactly one free slot at the end
	- Artifacts generate suspicion over time?
	- Random events?
		- Shouldn't be too powerful, to avoid upsetting the balance
		- Random discoveries during quests
		- Guaranteed events throughout the year/as you progress
	- Enemies (watch inspectors, rival cultists, eldritch abominations)
		- Separate type
	- Artifact powers, usable in assignments
		- Followers will still be required to perform the task
		- Artifacts can't "die", but if the last person in the task dies, the artifact is lost?
		- Stat buffs
	- Follower stats
		- Health
		- Strength (combat)
		- Intelligence (artifact seeking)
		- XP
	- Follower statuses
		- Wounded (during a raid or quest)
		- Stressed/unstable (going insane, caused by research, questing, or ritual)
		- Captured (by the watch, during a raid, theft, or bribery)
		- Unavailable (on a quest)
	- Follower, artifact, and wealth capacity?
		- Spend wealth to upgrade
	- New raid options
		- Fight them off
			- Gain suspicion
			- Combat check with chance of death, wound, or capture
		- Bribe with LOTS of wealth
	- New assignments
		- Work
			- Earn small amount of wealth for no suspicion
		- Steal
			- Earn large amount of wealth for high suspicion and chance of death (or capture)
		- Recruit cultist
			- Current recruit follower action: spend time and gain suspicion to recruit a cultist
			- Cultists have low strength but decent intelligence
		- Hire mercenary
			- Spend wealth and time to hire a merc with decent strength but zero intelligence
		- Bribe
			- Spend wealth to reduce suspicion
		- Scapegoat
			- Sacrifice a follower to reduce suspicion
		- Rituals
			- Summon entities which can be used as powerful followers, but only for certain tasks
			- Sacrifice followers and/or artifacts
		- Remove "quell suspicion"
			- Too cheap; once wealth exists then there's a better cost for reducing suspicion
- UI
	- Report screen after each turn where something happened?
	- Menu
	- HBox of suspicion icons?
	- Quit button
	- Restart button
	- Quit, restart, or continue on end screen
- Art
	- Assignment icons
- Juice
	- Particles
		- Death
		- New follower
		- New artifact
		- Assignment completion
- Sounds
	- Pick up
	- Drop
	- End turn
	- Death
	- New follower
	- New artifact
	- Assignment completion
- Music and/or ambiance
- Procgen end text?
- Procgen art
	- Modulate artifact colors (split into 2 TextureRects: colored and uncolored)
	- Faces
		- Modulate colors
			- Skin color
			- Hair color
			- Eye color?
		- Others are harder and require some art compatibility matching
			- Face shape
				- This is the main driver of compatibility challenges
				- Limit this to a small number to reduce number of other sprites required
			- Hair
			- Facial hair
			- Facial feature
			- Eyes
	- Conditions
